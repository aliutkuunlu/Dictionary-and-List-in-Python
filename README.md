This is a simulation of "save the world" from a bad AI.

Details are below..


In 2052, something went terribly wrong. For years there had
been signs that something weird was going on with our technology,
but people chose to ignore them until it was too late.
In the beginning of the 21st century, many cool devices started
to emerge and get connected to the Internet, allowing numerous
life-changing applications. It all started with seemingly harmless
devices such as Web embedded weather forecasting toaster and
smart refrigerator, and you must admit, it was pretty cool to eat
a toast with a weather forecast for that day, and have your fridge
order groceries online to replenish them as necessary. We were getting lazier and lazier every
year as we relied on technology to do most of our jobs for us. As our devices were getting
smarter, we were getting lazier. When Kevin Ashton coined the term Internet of Things (IoT)
in 1999, little did he know into what kind of monster it would evolve in the future.
Pretty soon, Artificial Intelligence (AI) also developed
to such extent that humanoid robots emerged and
started doing our jobs for us. We considered this the
ultimate step in our evolution as intelligent beings:
we would never have to work again, because we had
computers and machines, our absolute slaves, do everything
for us.


So who was to blame when these machines became smarter and decided that they would do
much better job of running the world than humans, and that we were nothing but a waste
on this world that needed to be wiped out? The whole human race was responsible for our
demise, but one group of people in particular did the most damage: Computer Engineers. It
was because of them that the downfall of the human race happened so quickly. Especially you,
the future graduates of Hacettepe Computer Engineering department played a crucial role in
this catastrophe with your groundbreaking innovations in the fields of AI and IoT.
In the year of 2052, the human race will be forced to make their last stand against the
machines, because the main controller machine which named itself the C.M.L. (short for
the Control Mainframe Linker) as soon as it gained the control of all other devices and
computers in the world, decided to reprogram them for one purpose only: to terminate the
human race once and for all. Humans have become so pathetic and destructive on this planet,
that after spending many days and enormous amounts of high-performance computing power
on all of its CPUs and GPUs, the C.M.L. finally calculated that the only way to fulfill its
primary mission of making the world a better place is to completely eliminate the human
race

Someone , whose hacker name will later become BuFuQ (after a successful but short career of writing a blog about flying
shoes), will be the leader of the last human underground resistance movement. BuFuQ
will come up against the C.M.L. and try to upload the virus that will halt its evil plan,
by replacing the C.M.L.'s code with another substitute virus code that you must program
if you want to save the human race and atone for your future sin of making better and
smarter computers. BuFuQ will not be able to code the virus himself, because by that time
all computers will have submitted to the C.M.L. and if he tried to code anything on any
computer, his plan would be uncovered immediately. You will code the virus now, so that he
can hide it and use it when the time comes
